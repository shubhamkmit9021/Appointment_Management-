## Appointment_Management

I am building an Appointment Management application for Law Firms. Assume that the law firms are small with 5 or fewer lawyers in each firms
  1. Firms can have lawyers with multiple specialties.(eg divorce lawyer, criminal lawyer, property lawyer,etc)
  2. Each lawyer in the firm may be available for a certain duration of time.
  3. Each lawyer may charge different rates for the appointment

 
 ## Task is:
  1. Book an Appointment With a lawyer.
  2. If the number of bookings goes beyond lawyer availability show “Appointments not available”
  3. Given a lawyer, see complete appointment history
  
## functionality
- We can book the appointment.
- If any certain duration slot is already booked then "Appointments not available" alert is generated.
- All the booking history we can see the seperate page.
- We can also sort the entire booking data according to salary ascending and descending order.
- This is fully responsive and a good user interface.

### Technology used:
